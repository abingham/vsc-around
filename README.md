# Around extension for VS Code

Manage token around regions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

Puts before and after token around selected regions.

Just invoke the `around.around` command and select the token you want to surround your selection with. Some tokens, like parenthesis, will try to be smart by inserting the correct balancing token. Other tokens, like `"`, will just surround the region with two identical tokens.
